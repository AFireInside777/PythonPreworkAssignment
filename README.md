# PythonPreworkAssignment
This is a program which has five functions that were requested to be coded by the Coding Temple Prework Assignment.
I was going to add functionality that made sure all inputs from the user were exactly what is being requested by the program (this can be seen in the Title Menu), but I had already taken too much time to get the assignment done.

Please import the os module before running.
Python 3.11.2
